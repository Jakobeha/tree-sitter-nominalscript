[![Build Status](https://github.com/Jakobeha/tree-sitter-nominalscript/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Jakobeha/tree-sitter-nominalscript/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

[Nominalscript](https://github.com/Jakobeha/nominalscript.git) grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

This is derived from [tree-sitter-typescript](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-typescript). As such, the grammar is inside the `nominalscript` folder/field. In the future there may be an NSX equivalent, but probably not.

```js
require('tree-sitter-nominalscript').nominalscript; // Nominalscript grammar
```
